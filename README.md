# Asset distributions

This repository contains the code used to deploy and manage my asset distributions (webfonts, images, and such). I host these on S3 under the subdomain `assets.djsp.eu` and let CloudFront serve them.

I keep assets separate from my websites because some assets (mostly webfonts) are used across several websites.
